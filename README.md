# GOAP-AI-RTS-Project
An RTS project with focus on enemy AI. In this project I used the goal oriented action planning method (GOAP) to create an enemy AI that builds its own base and attacks the player. 

What is goal oriented action planning?


Goal oriented action planning short (GOAP) is an ai programming pattern that doesn't rely on a simple state machine but rather uses 
so called Actions which are being executed in a specific order that is defined by the ActionPlanner.
